Neural mechanisms of attention and working memory.

## Current Work

### Feature multiplexing in V4 reflects natural image statistics. 
I use a combination of electrophysiology and statistical techniques from machine learning to investigate high-dimensional feature tuning in visual area V4. The central conceit of this project supposes that the brain uses a latent coding model to efficiently represent information from the visual world

### Feature-based attention in the middle temporal (MT) area acts heterogenously across populations of diversly-tuned neurons
I'm using simultaneous recordings in MT and PFC to investigate how visual information in Mt is altered through reciprical activity with PFC during active engagement. We posit that the prefrontal cortex acts to "optimize" stimulus processing for currrent behavioral goals.
